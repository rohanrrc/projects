RISC-V Projects
===============

This directory contains one of my projects on Computer Architecture (Branch Predictor, Cache Optimization, Instruction Issue Select, Processor Design). These projects consisnt of work done primarily on the Berkeley Out of Order Machine (BOOM) along with the RISC-V ISA.

Instruction Issue Selection:
----------------------------
This project focuses on the implementation of various instruction issue-select policies with a goal of minimizing the number of cycles per instruction (CPI) used by the processor. It uses the Berkeley Out of Order Machine (BOOM) to perform benchmarking, and run analytics on instances of the designed issue-select policies.
