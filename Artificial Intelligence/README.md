Artificial Intelligence Projects
================================

This repository contains some of my work on Artificial Intelligence. The projects included in this repository are as follows:

Optimal Search
--------------
This project is an exploration of AI based search algorithms and techniques using Pacman as an abstraction that provides a framework for the application of search algorithms.

Adversarial Search
------------------
This project is an implementation of multi-agent adversarial search algorithms that use minimax, expectimax and Alpha-Beta pruning to make optimal adversarial choices.

Reinforcement learning
----------------------
This project is an application of Value Iteration and Q-learning to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

Inference
---------
The focus of this project is the implemention of algorithms for performing both exact and approximate inference using Bayes' Nets and techniques such as particle filtering.
