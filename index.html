<a name="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome!</h2>

<p>This page contains links to a selection of my recent projects.
Here's a brief summary of the projects in the collection:</p>

<hr><h3>
<a name="android-projects" class="anchor" href="#android-projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Android Projects</h3>

<p><code>Transit App</code></p>

<p>This is an android app that I made from scratch. It provides real-time GPS tracking based prediction of bus and metro arrival times for 60+ transit agencies. The core framework used to get real time data is the Nextbus API.</p>

<h3>
<a name="artificial-intelligence-projects" class="anchor" href="#artificial-intelligence-projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Artificial Intelligence Projects</h3>

<p><code>Optimal Search</code></p>

<p>This project is an exploration of AI based search algorithms and techniques using Pacman as an abstraction that provides a framework for the application of search algorithms.</p>

<p><code>Adversarial Search</code></p>

<p>This project is an implementation of multi-agent adversarial search algorithms that use minimax, expectimax and Alpha-Beta pruning to make optimal adversarial choices.</p>

<p><code>Reinforcement learning</code></p>

<p>This project is an application of Value Iteration and Q-learning to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.</p>

<p><code>Inference</code></p>

<p>The focus of this project is the implemention of algorithms for performing both exact and approximate inference using Bayes' Nets and techniques such as particle filtering.</p>

<h3>
<a name="computer-architecture-projects-mainly-using-risc-v" class="anchor" href="#computer-architecture-projects-mainly-using-risc-v"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Computer Architecture Projects (mainly using RISC-V)</h3>

<p><code>Branch Prediction</code></p>

<p>This project simulates a wide array of different branch predictor designs for the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). The report.pdf file included along with the project files provides more information on the kind of simulations run and the results achieved.</p>

<p><code>Cache Optimization</code></p>

<p>The focus of the Cache Optimization project includes simulating a range of cache designs and analyzing the optimality of different configurations. A big part of this project involves designing a Victim Cache that performs better cache block replacement than current schemes.</p>

<p><code>Instruction Issue Selection</code></p>

<p>This project focuses on the implementation of various instruction issue-select policies with a goal of minimizing the number of cycles per instruction (CPI) used by the processor. It uses the Berkeley Out of Order Machine (BOOM) to perform benchmarking, and run analytics on instances of the designed issue-select policies. </p>

<p><code>Processor Design</code></p>

<p>This project includes the design of a processor from scratch using Logisim and other tools.</p>

<h3>
<a name="other-projects" class="anchor" href="#other-projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other projects</h3>

<p><code>Machine Player</code></p>

<p>This project is an implementation of a tactical strategy game called Network. It also includes the implementation of a machine player that one can play against. The machine player using minimax with alpha beta pruning to select optimal actions.</p>

<p><code>Hadoop Map Reduce</code></p>

<p>The focus of this project is an implementation of a generalized co-occurrence algorithm that works with the Hadoop Map Reduce framework and is able to run on Amazon's EC2.</p>
